After installing the app use 'npm run dev' to run it. (not 'npm start').

The app will launch on http://localhost:3000

Implementation Notes:

* Used create-react-app to get something running fast. (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* Decided there is no need for a state management library like Redux at this point.

Time Taken:

* 3 hours to get it all working.
* Then as much time as I liked to clean up the code fully, add a some tests and fix the local CORS issue.

TODO's:

* Continue to improve test coverage
* use CSS Modules (I would like to be able to do this without ejecting
